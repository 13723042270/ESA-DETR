  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under adverse weather conditions, detecting small traffic signs accurately is crucial for autonomous driving safety. This paper introduces ESA-DETR, an optimized algorithm designed to enhance detection accuracy and reliability. Leveraging an edge fusion block for boundary structure perception, a structure-enhanced feature fusion module for efficient multi-level feature integration, and an adaptive sparse feature interaction module for practical information focus, ESA-DETR achieves significant improvements. Experimental results on the TT100K and CCTSDB datasets demonstrate a mAP\(_{50}\)  increase of 2.4\% and 1.7\%, respectively, compared to baseline algorithms, with a 27\% reduction in model parameters and a 15\% decrease in computational load. These findings underscore the potential of ESA-DETR in real-world autonomous driving applications.
